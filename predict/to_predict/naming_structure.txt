List of 102 flower classifier flowers - http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html

For convenience there are some provided images of flowers to predict.
Noted down is the model they work with, their name, and the result of the prediction.
If you get different results (ie flower labeled as a hit and you get a miss) make sure that 
	the correct model for the flower is being used. 

File names are arranged like so:


If they start with either 17 or 102:
	This indicates what model they will work with
If they don't start with a number:
	This indicates that they work with both models
	
The next clump will be the full name of the flower.


Near the end of the filename will be one of the following:
	_hit
	_miss
	_top5
	
	hit means that it predicted the flower perfectly
	miss means that the actual flower wasn't in any of the predictions
	top4 means that the predicted flower wasn't number 1, but was in the top 5
